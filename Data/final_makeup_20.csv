","
Suggested Usage:
For defined lips:
-Line your lips using an Aqua Lip shade that matches your lipstick. 
-Create depth by shading in the edges of the mouth to create definition and blend towards the center. 
-Apply lipstick- starting from center of the lip and stretching to the outer corners.
-Finish with concealer outside of lip line to make the edge more defined.

Pro tip for fuller-looking lips:
-For more fullness- extend the liner just outside of the natural lip line. Fill in.
-For added dimension- use one to two shades darker than your desired lip color.
-Add your favorite gloss in the center of the top and bottom lips to create volume.

 A retractable lip liner with a long-lasting- gel-cream texture to enhance the lip contour.

What it does:
This first-to-market creamy gel lip liner is softer than a traditional liner. It is formulated with a gel-cream finish for an enhanced- smooth look without dullness. The unique- soft texture of the non-drying formula glides over every curve with ease to create a fuller look and a color-matched base for lipsticks. The liner also comes with a built-in sharpener for easy application anywhere.

What it is formulated WITHOUT:
- Parabens

Beauty Tip:
Enhance the look of lips with the new range of highlighting lip liners in champagne- pearl- and gold. Add volume to lips by applying on the Cupid’s bow. 

What else you need to know:
 All shades were specifically chosen to pair with existing top-selling #Lipstories and Cream lipsticks.
This product is not tested on animals.
Ingredient Note: 
All Sephora Collection products comply with the most rigorous international laws on product safety—going beyond satisfying European and US Cosmetics regulations. They also satisfy the strictest internal requirements of development- quality- traceability- and safety- and lead by example with a Restricted Substance List that excludes more than 1-400 substances.","Suggested Usage:
-Apply first to the outer lines of lips to create the perfect contour. 
-For added benefit- gradually fill in color all over lips to create the perfect lip base for any Rouge Cream or Shine lipstick. 
-Use the included built-in sharpener at the base of each pencil before pencil use.

 Precautions:
-Make sure to close the cap tightly to prevent premature drying of this creamy formula. -The creamy texture of this formula is unlike any lip liners on the market. It is imperative that you are gentle when applying lip pencil to lips as the tips are super soft and will bend with too much force.
